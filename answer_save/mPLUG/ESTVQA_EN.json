        "answer": "Merrill Lynch provides financial services, including investment banking, wealth management, and brokerage services. In the image, a man in a blue shirt is holding a baseball bat, which suggests that he might be a player or a coach in a baseball game. The presence of a baseball field and a crowd of people suggests that the event is likely related to a baseball game or a sports event. However, it is not possible to definitively determine the exact service being provided at Merrill Lynch from the image alone.",

Some salons offer eyelash extensions, which are synthetic or natural eyelashes attached to the existing eyelashes using adhesive. These extensions can last for several weeks and can be removed by a professional. The cost of eyelash extensions can range from $50 to $150 per session, with the average cost being around $100.\n\nAnother option is eyelash tinting, which involves applying a dye to the existing eyelashes to darken or lighten them. The cost of eyelash tinting can range from $10 to $30, depending on the salon and the type of dye used.\n\nIn contrast, eyelash growth serums and treatments are designed to promote natural eyelash growth. These products can be applied topically and may take several months to show results. The cost of these products can range from $20 to $100, depending on the brand and the duration of treatment.\n\nIn summary, the cost of eyelash lengthening can vary depending on the method used and the salon or professional offering the service. Eyelash extensions can be expensive, while eyelash tinting and growth serums can be more affordable.",

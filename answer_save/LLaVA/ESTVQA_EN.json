It is essential to check license plates, especially when dealing with cars parked in public spaces, to ensure compliance with parking rules, to identify stolen vehicles, or to avoid potential accidents with similar-looking cars. Public authorities and law enforcement use license plates to track vehicles and their owners, so having a license number can be important in various legal and regulatory situations.",
